service is a package used within MIG for service management. This includes
tasks such as installing/removing MIG components as OS services, and starting
and stopping services.

This code was originally forked from bitbucket.org/kardianos/service/ to
github.com/jvehent/service-go. Since then the code has been modified for MIG,
and as such now lives here.
